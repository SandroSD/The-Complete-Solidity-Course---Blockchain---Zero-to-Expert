## <u> Smart Contracts </u>
Smart contracts are digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predeterminated terms and conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.
